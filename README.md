This project was created as a part of the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ "Udemy") course _Remix.js - The Practical Guide_ by [Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://twitter.com/maxedapps "Maximilian Schwarzmüller on Twitter").

By preparing this project I learned some advanced stuff about Remix. Remix is really awesome!
